# ðŸ“Š Iris Dataset Analysis and Visualization

This project provides a full pipeline for loading, analyzing, and visualizing the **Iris dataset** using Python. It demonstrates basic data exploration, statistical summaries, and a variety of visualizations using popular data science libraries.

---

## âœ… Project Structure

1. **Data Loading** â€“ Uses `scikit-learn` to load the Iris dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Handles missing values.
3. **Basic Analysis** â€“ Computes summary statistics and species-based groupings.
4. **Data Visualization** â€“ Produces customized charts using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Make sure the following Python libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
# Python-Data-Analysis
Python data analysis tools applied in data visualization and organization using tools like the Iris Dataset

Save the script to a Python file, for example: iris_analysis.py.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing your script.

Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python iris_analysis.py
The script will:

Print basic information about the dataset.

Display descriptive statistics and grouped means.

Show a series of interactive plots (these will open in separate windows).

ðŸ“Š Visualizations Included
Each chart has been fully customized with titles, axis labels, and legends for clarity.

1. Line Chart
What it shows: Trend of petal length over sample index (simulating time).

Use case: Understand how petal length varies across samples and species.

2. Bar Chart
What it shows: Average petal length per species.

Use case: Compare how petal length differs by species.

3. Histogram
What it shows: Distribution of sepal width.

Use case: Identify the shape and spread of the sepal width data.

4. Scatter Plot
What it shows: Relationship between sepal length and petal length.

Use case: Visualize correlations and clustering among species.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
The Iris dataset is clean by default (no missing values), but the script still includes error handling and data cleaning steps.

All plots use seaborn for a modern, visually appealing style.

Ensure that your Python environment supports graphical output (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, IDLE, or a local IDE like VS Code).

ðŸ§  Insights
Iris-virginica typically has the highest values across all measured features.

Clear separations exist between species when visualized using scatter plots.
